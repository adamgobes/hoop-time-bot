This Facebook chat-bot allows students to find out when McGillâ€™s athletic facilities are available. 
The current sports supported are basketball, soccer, volleyball, and swimming. Additionally it can tell you when
the Currie Gymnasium or Fieldhouse is open for recreational sports.
This chat-bot was built primarily with NodeJS, ImmutableJS, and Google's API.AI NLP engine.
